# MinesweeperKata

A Maven project for implementing a Minesweeper Kata

http://codingdojo.org/kata/Minesweeper/

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AdvancedProgrammingWithJavaSummer2017/MinesweeperKata.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AdvancedProgrammingWithJavaSummer2017/MinesweeperKata)

## Before we dive into coding

### Make a fork of this repository

After breaking up into pairs, have one of the pairs with a GitHub account make a "[fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)" of this repository by clicking the "Fork" button above.  This will make a new repository in your personal GitHub section.

For this kata, it's important that you work in your own fork of the kata.  (@DavidWhitlock will do the same.)  Very likely, your ability to commit directly to this repository will be revoked.

### Brainstorm test cases

In your pairs or small groups, identify some test cases in the form "given/when/then".  Try to think of the simplest scenarios that could possibly work.

### We'll author some unit tests together

Let's try a variation on TDD: Let's author a handful of tests, but not implement them fully.  We'll get them to compile in order to flesh out the API of the `Minesweeper` class.  Once we have a critical mass of tests, we'll commit them back to this repository so that everyone can then use them as the basis of implementing the kata.

### Get the latest changes into your repository

In order to get the test cases and skeleton of the `Minesweeper` class into your fork, follow the workflow to "[sync](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)" a fork.

## Implement your code and add more test cases

This kata is a little more advanced that our other ones, so we might do this over two nights.  Get your test cases working and some new ones.

After a half-hour or so, we'll report out on our process.  Instead of sharing our IntelliJ, put up a "[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)" to make your changes in your fork visible to everyone else.  Note that creating a pull requests (PR) will trigger a build for the PR in Travis CI: https://travis-ci.org/AdvancedProgrammingWithJavaSummer2017/MinesweeperKata/pull_requests

## Review pull requests

Take some time as pairs to review the pull requests of other pairs.

https://github.com/AdvancedProgrammingWithJavaSummer2017/MinesweeperKata/pulls

Comment on them in GitHub and respond to the comments that you receive.

## Discuss what we learned

Then, as a class, let's talk about what we learned from this exercise, both the kata and working with GitHub.
